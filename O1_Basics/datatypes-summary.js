// How we store or retrive, based on this datatype classified into two type officialy
// Primitive and Non-Primitive or Referenced type

//  Primitive : call by value type, original referenced is not share while coping

//  7 types : String, Number, Boolearn, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

/* 
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that the type of a variable is checked during runtime, as opposed to static typing where types are checked during compilation. In JavaScript, a variable can hold values of different types throughout its lifespan in the program. There is no need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The interpreter assigns a type to the variable at runtime based on its current value.
